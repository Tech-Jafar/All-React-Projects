<h1> What is React</h1>
<p>React is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces, primarily for web applications. It was developed by Facebook and is now maintained by Meta and an open-source community. React allows developers to build complex UIs by breaking them down into smaller, reusable components. Some key features of React include:</p>

<ul>
  <li> <b>Components:</b> React is built around the concept of components, which are self-contained UI elements that can be reused throughout your application.</li>
  <li><b> Virtual DOM:</b> React uses a virtual representation of the DOM, which is more efficient than directly manipulating the actual DOM.</li>
  <li><b> State management:</b>b> React provides a way to manage state with in components, which makes it easier to build complex UIs.</li>
  <li><b>JSX:</b> React uses a syntax extension called JSX, which allows you to write HTML-like code within your JavaScript files.</li>
</ul>
