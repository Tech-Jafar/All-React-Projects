<h1>What is React ðŸ“Œ</h1>
<p>React is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces, primarily for web applications. It was developed by Facebook and is now maintained by Meta and an open-source community. React allows developers to build complex UIs by breaking them down into smaller, reusable components. Some key features of React include:</p>

<ul>
  <li> <b>Components:</b> React is built around the concept of components, which are self-contained UI elements that can be reused throughout your application.</li>
  <li><b> Virtual DOM:</b> React uses a virtual representation of the DOM, which is more efficient than directly manipulating the actual DOM.</li>
  <li><b> State management:</b>b> React provides a way to manage state with in components, which makes it easier to build complex UIs.</li>
  <li><b>JSX:</b> React uses a syntax extension called JSX, which allows you to write HTML-like code within your JavaScript files.</li>
</ul>

</ul>

<h3>3.method using npm vite</h3>

```bash
npm create vite@latest
cd tech-app 
npm install
npm run dev
```
<h3>What is vite+react</h3>
<p>Vite is a fast build tool for modern web projects. To create a React app with Vite, use:
It offers faster dev servers and optimized builds compared to traditional tools like Create React App.
